# Employee Management System

This is a single spring boot application that offers the functionality to perform a CRUD operation on the employee's data.

In this application, we have used Java, Spring Boot, hibernate, JPA, MySql, and Lombok.

To run this application, create a database with the name Employee and a table called Employees in that database. Ensure that the default ports are used.
